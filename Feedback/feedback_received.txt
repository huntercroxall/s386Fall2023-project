Choosing a Topic:
    What Feedback Did I Received?
    - I talked to a number of individuals (my family and my co-workers at the Testing Center) about this project.
    I initially wanted to examine drug related cases
    from the OpenFDA API, but I received the feedback that people might be more interested in something
    completely random, since I'm into random things like that.

    What Changes Did I Make Because of that Feedback?
    - Because of the feedback I received, I decided to examine egg-related recall events from the same OpenFDA 
    API. This topic is quite random, but I think it is kinda fun to learn about what may seem like non-sensical things.
    As far as I can tell, someone took the time to gather all of this data on eggs, so someone ought to use it for the
    education of the people.

    What Feedback Did I Received?
    - Byron: Very well documented and easy to follow. You were clear with your explanations and
     have plenty of links to relevant things.  

    - Brady: It was helpful that you showed your code for each section of the project
    I thought that you explained each step of the process well, including how to get an API key for this particular api
    Maybe showing a screenshot of a snippet of your dataset could be helpful for visualing the results of your collection process.

    - Byron: EDA blog looks amazing, its well written and easy to follow. I liked the differences in visuals,
     they gave a good spread in information.
