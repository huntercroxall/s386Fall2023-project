Choosing a Topic:
    What Feedback Did I Received?
    - I talked to a number of individuals (my family and my co-workers at the Testing Center) about this project.
    I initially wanted to examine drug related cases
    from the OpenFDA API, but I received the feedback that people might be more interested in something
    completely random, since I'm into random things like that.

    What Changes Did I Make Because of that Feedback?
    - Because of the feedback I received, I decided to examine egg-related recall events from the same OpenFDA 
    API. This topic is quite random, but I think it is kinda fun to learn about what may seem like non-sensical things.
    As far as I can tell, someone took the time to gather all of this data on eggs, so someone ought to use it for the
    education of the people.


Data Collection Blog:
    What Feedback Did I Received?
    - Byron: Very well documented and easy to follow. You were clear with your explanations and
     have plenty of links to relevant things.  

    - Brady: It was helpful that you showed your code for each section of the project
    I thought that you explained each step of the process well, including how to get an API key for this particular api
    Maybe showing a screenshot of a snippet of your dataset could be helpful for visualing the results of your collection process.
    
    - Jacob: Good job separating code from words! I think you could simplify the wordiness of the intro and the conclusion.

    What Changes Did I Make Because of that Feedback?
    - Based on the feedback that I received, I edited my intro and conclusion. I also added a code snippet at the end to show the
    finished product after gathering the data.


Exploratory Analysis Blog:
    What Feedback Did I Received?
    - Byron: EDA blog looks amazing, its well written and easy to follow. I liked the differences in visuals,
     they gave a good spread in information. 

    - Brady: You included some awesome visualizations that gave me a good idea of how egg recall values were distributed among different categories.
    It would be helpful on Viz 6 to see each name of the month instead of number, but that could be a preference thing
    Also, you could summarize each graph under each individual graph instead of including it all in 1 section at the end

    - Jacob: You should better deliniate the difference between each visualization by separating each section with a line or something.

    What Changes Did I Make Because of that Feedback?
    - I addded separating lines to clarify what captions go with which visualization. I feel that doing this absolved both of the concerns shared
    through the feedback received.


Dashboard:
    What Feedback Did I Received?
    - Byron: Your dashboard is fantastic as well, it shows your EDA graphs clearly and simply. 

    - Brady: I liked seeing the change in number of recalls as the years went on, that gave me a good idea of how those figures change
    It would be cool to have some filtering sliders or boxes to adjust the range of years or states, so you could see more specific comparisons
    Good job!

    - Jacob: I found the dashboard to be a bit confusing, perhaps if you added some additional charts you could make the dashboard more interactive.
    I also feel like there was too much blank space between items that made for a waste of space.

    What Changes Did I Make Because of that Feedback?
    - I added simple additional charts to make the dashboard more interactive. I also tried to minimize whitespace and organize charts in a
    more managable fashion.
